# Example NPG Package Blacklist Configuration
# Copy this to blacklist.yml to enable package blocking

# Block packages (entirely or specific versions)
packages:
  - name: malicious-package
    reason: Known malware - blocks all versions

  - name: crypto-stealer
    reason: Cryptocurrency theft malware

  - name: '@evil/package'
    reason: Malicious scoped package

  - name: event-stream
    versions: [3.3.6]
    reason: Contains bitcoin mining malware (exact version)

  - name: colors
    versions: ['>=1.4.44 <1.4.46']
    reason: DoS vulnerability (semver range)

# When 'versions' is specified, only those versions/ranges are blocked
# When 'versions' is omitted, the entire package is blocked
# Supports both exact versions and semver ranges:
# - Exact: ['1.2.3', '2.0.0']
# - Ranges: ['>=1.4.44 <1.4.46', '^2.0.0', '~1.5.0']
# - Mixed: ['1.2.3', '>=2.0.0 <3.0.0']

# Pattern-based blocking (regex)
patterns:
  - pattern: '.*malware.*'
    reason: Suspicious package name containing "malware"

  - pattern: '^(test|demo)-.*-stealer$'
    reason: Common pattern for credential stealers
